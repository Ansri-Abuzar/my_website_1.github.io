            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and solve problems like humans. It's a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent agents, which perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chance of achieving defined goals.</p>
            <p>In simpler terms, AI aims to make computers perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning from data</li>
                <li>Recognizing patterns</li>
                <li>Understanding natural language</li>
                <li>Solving problems</li>
                <li>Making decisions</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="types-of-ai">
            <h2>Types of AI</h2>
            <p>AI can be categorized in various ways, but two common classifications are:</p>
            <h3>1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)</h3>
            <p>This type of AI is designed and trained for a specific task. It operates within a pre-defined range of functions and cannot perform outside its programmed capabilities. Most of the AI we interact with today falls into this category.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (Netflix, Amazon), spam filters, facial recognition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. General AI (Strong AI)</h3>
            <p>This theoretical type of AI would possess human-like cognitive abilities across a wide range of tasks. It would be capable of understanding, learning, and applying intelligence to any intellectual task that a human being can do. General AI does not yet exist.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Examples (currently theoretical):</strong> A machine that can genuinely learn any new skill, reason about complex problems across domains, and exhibit self-awareness.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="how-ai-works">
            <h2>How AI Works (Simplified)</h2>
            <p>AI systems primarily work by processing large amounts of data to identify patterns and make predictions or decisions. Key components include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Algorithms are trained on data to recognize patterns and make predictions.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning (DL):</strong> A subset of Machine Learning that uses neural networks with many layers ("deep" networks) to learn from vast amounts of data. This is particularly effective for complex pattern recognition tasks like image and speech recognition.</li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> Enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> Allows computers to "see" and interpret visual information from the world, like images and videos.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="applications">
            <h2>Common Applications of AI</h2>
            <p>AI is already integrated into many aspects of our daily lives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Disease diagnosis, drug discovery, personalized treatment plans.</li>
                <li><strong>Automotive:</strong> Self-driving cars, predictive maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, personalized banking.</li>
                <li><strong>Education:</strong> Personalized learning, intelligent tutoring systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Retail:</strong> Customer service chatbots, personalized shopping experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Entertainment:</strong> Content recommendations, game AI.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
            <p>AI is a rapidly evolving field with immence potential. As technology advances, AI is expected to continue transforming industries, enhancing productivity, and solving complex global challenges. Ethical considerations, data privacy, and the responsible development of AI are crucial areas of ongoing discussion and research.</p>
